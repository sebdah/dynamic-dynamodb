Configuration options
=====================

The sections below describe the various options available in the Dynamic DynamoDB configuration file. See :ref:`_example_configuration <Example configuration>` for an example configuration file.

Global configuration
--------------------

**Section name:** ``[global]``

===================================== ========= ============= ==========================================
Option                                Type      Default       Comment
===================================== ========= ============= ==========================================
aws-access-key-id                     ``str``                  AWS access API key
aws-secret-access-key-id              ``str``                  AWS secret API key
check-interval                        ``int``   300           How many seconds to wait between the checks
circuit-breaker-timeout               ``float`` 10000.00      Timeout for the circuit breaker, in ms
circuit-breaker-url                   ``str``                  URL to poll for circuit breaking. Dynamic DynamoDB will only run if the circuit breaker returns ``HTTP/200``
region                                ``str``   ``us-east-1`` AWS region to use
===================================== ========= ============= ==========================================

Logging configuration
---------------------

**Section name:** ``[logging]``

===================================== ======= ============= ==========================================
Option                                Type    Default       Comment
===================================== ======= ============= ==========================================
log-file                              ``str``                Path to log file. Logging to stdout if this option is not present
log-level                             ``str``  ``info``      Log level (``debug``, ``info``, ``warning`` or ``error``)
log-config-file                       ``str``                Path to external Python logging configuration file. Overrides both ``log-level`` and ``log-file``. An example can be found in the Example configuration section.
===================================== ======= ============= ==========================================

Dynamic DynamoDB will rotate the ``log-file`` nightly per default and keep 5 days of backups. If you want to override this behavior, please have a look at the ``log-config-file`` option which allows you to use custom Python logging configuration files.

Table configuration
-------------------

**Section name:** ``[table: ^my_table$]``

Important note: The table name is treated as a regular expression. That means that ``my_table`` also will match ``my_table2``, unless you express it as a valid regular expression; ``^my_table$``. This feature enables you to easily configure many tables or tables with dynamic names.

Please note also that DynamoDB writes CloudWatch data every 5 minutes, thus ``reads/writes-upper/lower-threshold`` and ``throttled-reads/writes-upper-threshold`` is counted over 5 minute intervals.

Global secondary index configuration
------------------------------------

**Section name:** ``[gsi: ^my_gsi$ table: ^my_table$]``

Important note: Both the GSI name and the table name is treated as regular expressions. That means that ``my_gsi`` also will match ``my_gsi``, unless you express it as a valid regular expression; ``^my_gsi$``. This feature enables you to easily configure many GSIs with one configuration section.

The ``table:`` section after ``gsi:`` **must** match with an existing ``table:`` section.

Please note also that DynamoDB writes CloudWatch data every 5 minutes, thus ``reads/writes-upper/lower-threshold`` and ``throttled-reads/writes-upper-threshold`` is counted over 5 minute intervals.

Default configuration
---------------------

**Section name:** ``[default_options]``

Are you tired of setting the same configuration options for multiple tables or indexes? Then use the ``[default_options]`` section. It will let you create default values for all your tables and indexes. You can of course override those values by setting other values in your table or index specific configuration.
